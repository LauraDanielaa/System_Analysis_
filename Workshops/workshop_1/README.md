Workshop number 1 of systems analysis is based on making a fictitious database consisting 
of 50,000 genetic DNA sequences, where each DNA sequence has between 10 and 20 
nucleotide bases. In the database the most repeated DNA sequences of 6 and 8 nucleotide
bases (called motifs) are calculated, after which all the most repeated 6 and 8 base strands 
are printed
